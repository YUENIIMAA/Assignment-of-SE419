# A technical report about  computer network

- ### Definition

  A **computer network** is a [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal) [telecommunications network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network) which allows [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) to share resources. In computer networks, [computing devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_device) [exchange data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission) with each other using connections ([data links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link)) between nodes. These data links are established over [cable media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_cables) such as wires or optic cables, or [wireless media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network) such as [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi).

- ### Network packet

  A **network packet** is a formatted unit of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) carried by a [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network). A packet consists of control information and user data,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet#cite_note-1) which is also known as the [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing)). Control information provides data for delivering the payload, for example: source and destination [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address), [error detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection) codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet [headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing)) and [trailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(computing)).

  In packet switching, the [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)) of the communication medium is shared between multiple communication sessions, in contrast to [circuit switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching), in which circuits are preallocated for the duration of one session and data is typically transmitted as a continuous [bit stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_stream).

  There is no denying that packet switching, which we are using today, is far better than the circuit switching because of better fault handling. Suppose we lost or broke a package on the road, we can use error detecting codes to find the broken package, and resend the package. In my humble opinion, it is much harder for bit stream to achieve this effect.

  In the seven-layer [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) of [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking), *packet* strictly refers to a [protocol data unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_data_unit) at layer 3, the [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). The correct term for a data unit at layer 2, the [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer), is a *frame*, and at Layer 4, the [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer), the correct term is *segment* or *datagram*. For TCP/IP communication over [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet), a [TCP segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_segment) is carried in one or more [IP packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_packet_(disambiguation)), which are each carried in one or more [Ethernet frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame).

- ### OSI model

  - #### Definition

    The **Open Systems Interconnection model** (**OSI model**) is a [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model) that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication) or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocols). The model partitions a communication system into [abstraction layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer). The original version of the model had seven layers.

  - #### Layer 1: Physical Layer

    The [physical layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer) is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical [transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium). It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals. Layer specifications define characteristics such as voltage levels, the timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, modulation scheme, channel access method and physical connectors. This includes the layout of [pins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_(electronics)), [voltages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage), line [impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance), cable specifications, signal timing and frequency for wireless devices. Bit rate control is done at the physical layer and may define transmission mode as [simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_communication), [half duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Half-duplex), and [full duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Full-duplex). The components of a physical layer can be described in terms of a [network topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology). [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth), [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_physical_layer), and [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) all have specifications for a physical layer.

  - #### Layer 2: Data Link Layer

    The [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer) provides [node-to-node data transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node-to-node_data_transfer)—a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)) between them.

    [IEEE 802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802) divides the data link layer into two sublayers:[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#cite_note-7)

    - [Medium access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_access_control) (MAC) layer – responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data.
    - [Logical link control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_link_control) (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization.

    The MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as [802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.3) [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet), [802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11) [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi), and [802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.15.4) [ZigBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee) operate at the data link layer.

    The [Point-to-Point Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol) (PPP) is a data link layer protocol that can operate over several different physical layers, such as [synchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_serial_communication) and [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_serial_communication) serial lines.

    The [ITU-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T) [G.hn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn) standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer that provides both [error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction) and flow control by means of a [selective-repeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_repeat) [sliding-window protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window_protocol).

  - #### Layer 3: Network Layer

    The [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) sequences (called [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet)) from one node to another connected in "different networks". A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an *address* and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing) it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.

    Message delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so.

    A number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the *management annex*, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.

  - #### Layer 4: Transport Layer

    The [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.

    The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, [segmentation/desegmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_segmentation), and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and re-transmit those that fail delivery. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred. The transport layer creates segments out of the message received from the application layer. Segmentation is the process of dividing a long message into smaller messages.

    An easy way to visualize the transport layer is to compare it with a post office, which deals with the dispatch and classification of mail and parcels sent. A post office inspects only the outer envelope of mail to determine its delivery. Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, [tunneling protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol) operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM)'s [SNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Systems_Network_Architecture) or [Novell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell)'s [IPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork_Packet_Exchange) over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec). While [Generic Routing Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Routing_Encapsulation) (GRE) might seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at the endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete Layer 2 frames or Layer 3 packets to deliver to the endpoint. [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol) carries [PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol) frames inside transport segments.

    Although not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP) and the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.

  - #### Layer 5: Session Layer

    The [session layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_layer) controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for [full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)), [half-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-duplex), or [simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_communication) operation, and establishes procedures for checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session. In the OSI model, this layer is responsible for gracefully closing a session, which is handled in the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) at the transport layer in the Internet Protocol Suite. This layer is also responsible for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use [remote procedure calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call).

  - #### Layer 6: Presentation Layer

    The [presentation layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer) establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation protocol data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units and passed down the [protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack).

    This layer provides independence from data representation by translating between application and network formats. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. This layer formats data to be sent across a network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#cite_note-10) The presentation layer can include compression functions.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#cite_note-11) The Presentation Layer negotiates the Transfer Syntax.

    The original presentation structure used the [Basic Encoding Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Encoding_Rules) of [Abstract Syntax Notation One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) (ASN.1), with capabilities such as converting an [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC)-coded text [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) to an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)-coded file, or [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) of [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) and other [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) from and to [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML). ASN.1 effectively makes an application protocol invariant with respect to syntax.

  - #### Layer 7: Application Layer

    The [application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application-layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. The most important distinction in the application layer is the distinction between the application-entity and the application. For example, a reservation website might have two application-entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for a remote database protocol to record reservations. Neither of these protocols have anything to do with reservations. That logic is in the application itself. The application layer per se has no means to determine the availability of resources in the network.
