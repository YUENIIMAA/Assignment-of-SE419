# A technical report about  computer network

- ### Definition

  A **computer network** is a [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal) [telecommunications network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network) which allows [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) to share resources. In computer networks, [computing devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_device) [exchange data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission) with each other using connections ([data links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link)) between nodes. These data links are established over [cable media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_cables) such as wires or optic cables, or [wireless media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network) such as [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi).
